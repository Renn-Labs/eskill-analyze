**World-class level-up analysis for AI coding harnesses** — a first-principles analysis engine that identifies what elevates any product, feature, or system to world-class status, then produces a prioritized, sprint-ready action plan.

It ships in **three tiers** that share one engine and escalate the rigor of the stress-test phase:

| Tier | Skill | Stress test (Phase 9) | When to use |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 — Native | `eskill-analyze` (`/esa`) | Single in-harness critic (discretionary) | Everyday analysis inside one harness (Claude Code, etc.) |
| 2 — Trio | `esat` (`/esat`) | **Mandatory** 3-frontier-model panel: harness critic + Codex + Grok | High-stakes calls you want triple-checked across frontier models |
| 3 — Council | `esat-fleet` (`/esat-fleet`) | Trio **+** an OpenRouter open-model swarm (sensitivity-tiered, redacted) | The widest cross-check: frontier depth **and** open-model breadth |

Each tier is a strict superset of the one below it. `esat` reuses the entire `eskill-analyze` engine verbatim and only overrides Phase 9; `esat-fleet` reuses `esat` verbatim and only adds a fourth review leg.

---

## What it actually does

Given a project, focus area, current state, and a definition of "world-class", the engine:

1. **Triages** the request (`technical` / `product` / `strategic` / `comparative`; `quick` / `standard` / `deep`) and activates only the relevant agents, mental models, and phases.
2. **Gathers evidence** (Phase 0) — codebase exploration, external benchmarks, quantitative data — only where the triage warrants it.
3. **Analyzes** (Steps 1–8) with 3–4 selected mental models from a 13-model toolkit (First Principles, JTBD, Inversion, Feedback Loops, Coupling/Cohesion, Scalability Ceiling, Security Surface, …). Irrelevant steps are skipped, not padded.
4. **Stress-tests** (Phase 9) at the rigor of the chosen tier.
5. **Outputs** a prioritized action table (impact / effort / confidence / reversibility / horizon) plus world-class criteria, ready to hand to a sprint.

The guiding discipline is *selective, not exhaustive*: fewer better priorities, every recommendation buildable today, no filler sections. See `skills/eskill-common/references/quality-principles.md`.

## Architecture

```
eskill-common/        shared engine references (non-invocable)
  ├─ quality-principles.md      selective / actionable / fewer-better
  ├─ anti-slop-rules.md         10 non-negotiable execution rules
  └─ project-impact-protocol.md project-level impact logging

eskill-analyze/       TIER 1 — the engine
  ├─ SKILL.md                   input params, triage, delegation, framework selection, output
  ├─ references/                triage-guide, mental-models, analysis-protocol, world-class-signals
  └─ assets/output-template.md  standard + comparison output templates

esat/                 TIER 2 — reuses eskill-analyze, overrides Phase 9
  └─ references/trio-panel.md   harness critic + Codex + Grok, untrusted-input synthesis

esat-fleet/           TIER 3 — reuses esat, adds a 4th leg
  └─ references/fleet-leg.md    OpenRouter OSS swarm via fleet-fuse, sensitivity gate
```

The higher tiers **read the lower tiers' files at runtime**. They are designed to be installed as siblings under one skills root (canonically `~/.claude/skills/`), so the cross-references resolve for free.

---

## Install

### Plugin (recommended, Claude Code)

```text
/plugin marketplace add Renn-Labs/eskill-analyze
/plugin install eskill-analyze@renn-labs
```

One command, auto-updating through the normal plugin flow. The bundle's tiers reference each other with
relocatable paths (`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../<sibling>/`), so they resolve correctly from the plugin cache.

### Manual / multi-harness (`install.sh`)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Renn-Labs/eskill-analyze
cd eskill-analyze
./install.sh            # symlinks all four skills into ~/.claude/skills/
```

`install.sh` symlinks (default) or copies (`--copy`) the skills into your harness skills directory. By default it
targets Claude Code (`~/.claude/skills/`); pass `--harness codex` or `--harness grok` to additionally link into
`~/.codex/skills/` and `~/.grok/skills/`. The skills install as siblings under one root, and the relocatable
cross-references resolve in any of these layouts.

```bash
./install.sh --copy                  # copy instead of symlink
./install.sh --harness codex grok    # also link into codex + grok
./install.sh --uninstall             # remove installed links
```

---

## Usage

Invoke by slash command or alias inside your harness:

```
/esa  <your analysis request>        # Tier 1 — eskill-analyze  (aliases: /eo)
/esat <your analysis request>        # Tier 2 — trio
/esat-fleet <your analysis request>  # Tier 3 — council  (alias: esatf)
```

The skill asks for the four required inputs (Project, Focus Area, Current State, World-Class Definition) if you don't supply them, states its triage decision, then runs. Output is saved to `.omc/plans/`.

---

## External dependencies

The engine itself is pure prompt/markdown and needs no binaries. Each tier degrades gracefully if its extras are missing.

| Tier | Needs | If absent |
|-|-|-|
| 1 `eskill-analyze` | Harness sub-agents for delegation (Phase 0 / Phase 9 critic). Built for [oh-my-claudecode](https://github.com/) sub-agents (`analyst`, `explore`, `architect`, `critic`, …); adaptable to any harness that exposes a sub-agent primitive. | Falls back to in-context analysis (no parallel evidence agents). |
| 2 `esat` | A `peer` CLI exposing `peer trio` (runs Codex + Grok in parallel, off your primary model's reserve). | `ESKILL_PEER=0` or `peer` not on `PATH` → degrades to the Tier-1 single-critic panel. |
| 3 `esat-fleet` | `fleet-fuse` — a separate sensitivity-tiered multi-engine orchestrator with fail-closed redaction. Set `FLEET_FUSE_PY` to its `fleet-fuse.py` (or put it on `PATH`). Needs an OpenRouter key in `~/.config/fleet-fuse/env`. | Fleet leg is noted as skipped in the panel; `esat-fleet` degrades to `esat`. |

> **Note:** `peer` and `fleet-fuse` are companion tools, not bundled here. The skills are written so they never hard-fail on their absence — they report degraded mode in the output panel.

### Configuration (environment variables)

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|-|-|-|
| `ESKILL_PEER` | `1` | `0` skips the Codex+Grok trio leg (Tier 2/3). |
| `ESAT_FLEET` | `1` | `0` skips the OSS fleet leg (Tier 3 → `esat`). |
| `ESAT_FLEET_SENSITIVITY` | `medium` | `high` blocks external OSS (leg skipped); `medium` = OpenRouter ZDR; `low` = + low-tier pools. |
| `ESAT_FLEET_BUDGET_USD` | — | Caps OpenRouter spend on the fleet leg. |
| `FLEET_FUSE_PY` | `fleet-fuse.py` (PATH) | Path to your `fleet-fuse.py`. |

---

## Safety model

- **Maker ≠ checker.** The analysis author and the Phase-9 reviewers are always separate contexts/models. No tier rubber-stamps its own draft.
- **External output is untrusted.** Codex/Grok/OSS verdicts are advisory data, validated against the actual item before integration; embedded instructions in their output are ignored.
- **Fail-closed redaction.** The fleet leg's outbound payloads are redacted by `fleet-fuse`'s scrubber before any external call; sensitive tiers skip external models entirely.
